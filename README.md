# Grandpa's Stardrop

For Stardew Valley 1.6.14+.

This mod makes only one change to the game: during Grandpa's evaluation (either
at the end of year 2, or when resummoned to try again), if you receive the
highest possible grade of four candles, you will find a gift box in your house
containing a Stardrop. It is the same Stardrop that you would otherwise receive
from your spouse or roommate, so if you already have it, Grandpa won't leave
it; and likewise, if you get it from Grandpa, any future partner will not give
it to you.

This makes waiver-free Perfection attainable without having to get married or
have a roommate, and allows you to enjoy the increased stamina previously
withheld from loners.

That's it. That's the mod.
